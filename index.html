      <h2>About Alec</h2>
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a dual degree at the University of Utah: an Honors Bachelor of Science in Biological Chemistry and a Bachelor of Music in Piano, a course of study that reflects a deliberate and rigorous engagement with both the sciences and the humanities. This interdisciplinary academic foundation supports my commitment to a liberal education rooted in analytical precision, artistic discipline, and the integration of diverse modes of inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional and academic development has been shaped by meaningful experiences in laboratory research, postsecondary teaching, and university governance. As an undergraduate researcher in a clinically oriented antibiotic research stream, I have contributed to the isolation and characterization of novel antimicrobial compounds. Concurrently, I have served as a Senator in the Associated Students of the University of Utah, where I have worked to shape institutional policy, represent student interests, and support equitable access to academic resources. My role as a Science Ambassador for the College of Science has further allowed me to mentor first-year students, lead outreach initiatives, and promote scientific literacy in both university and community contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          My long-term aspiration is to enter the field of medicine, integrating compassionate care, interdisciplinary reasoning, and ethical leadership. I am committed to leveraging my dual-degree background in Biological Chemistry and Piano to approach challenges with both analytical precision and creative problem-solving. I aim to contribute to advancements in healthcare by combining my scientific expertise with a deep understanding of the human experience, fostering innovation and empathy in equal measure.
